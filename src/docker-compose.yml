# replace "ptb" with the short name of your project
# mongodb, public_bot and private_bot are service names. They should be unique in this project.
# ptb_mongodb, ptb_public_bot and ptb_private_bot are container names. They should be unique as well across projects.
# best practice is prefix them with the short name of your project.

# below we register three services
